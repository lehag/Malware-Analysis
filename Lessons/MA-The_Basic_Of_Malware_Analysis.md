# The basic of malware analysis

## NIST

Malware, also known as malicious code, refers to a program that compromises
the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data,
applications, or operating system.

## ENISA

The word Malware is derived from the term 'Malicious Software'. Any piece of
software that performs undesirable operations such as data theft or some other
type of computer compromise can be categorised as Malware.

## SANS

Malware is software or computer program used to perform malicious actions.
In fact, the term malware is a combination of the words malicious and software.
Cyber-criminals install malware on your computers or devices to gain control
over them or gain access to what they contain. Once installed, these attackers
can use malware to spy on your online activities, steal your passwords and files,
or use your system to attack others. Malware can even deny access to your own
files, demanding that you pay the attacker a ransom to regain control of them.

## Types of malware

Malware is a broad term that can refer to various types of malicious programs.
The symptoms caused by these different types of malware may sometimes
be similar. However, they mainly differ in the way they spread and infect
systems.

| Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Viruses                      | A virus self-replicates by inserting copies of itself into host programs or data files. Viruses are often triggered through user  interaction, such as opening a file or running a program. Viruses can be divided into the following two subcategories: – Compiled Viruses. A compiled virus is executed by an operating system. Types of compiled viruses include file infector viruses, which attach themselves to executable programs; boot sector viruses, which infect the master boot records of hard drives or the boot sectors of removable media; and multipartite viruses, which combine the characteristics of file infector and boot sector viruses.  –Interpreted Viruses. Interpreted viruses are executed by an application. Within this subcategory, macro viruses take advantage of the capabilities of applications’ macro programming language to infect application documents and document templates, while scripting viruses infect scripts that are understood by scripting languages processed by services on the OS. |
| Worms                        | A worm is a self-replicating, self-contained program that usually executes itself without user intervention. Worms are divided into two categories:  – Network Service Worms. A network service worm takes advantage of a vulnerability in a network service to propagate itself and infect other hosts.  – Mass Mailing Worms. A mass-mailing worm is similar to an email-borne virus but is self-contained, rather than infecting an existing file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Trojan Horses                | A Trojan horse is a self-contained, non-replicating program that, while appearing to be benign, actually has a hidden malicious purpose. Trojan horses either replace existing files with malicious versions or add new malicious files to hosts. They often deliver other attacker tools to hosts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Malicious Mobile Code        | Malicious mobile code is software with malicious intent that is  transmitted from a remote host to a local host and then executed on the local host, typically without the user’s explicit instruction. Popular languages for malicious mobile code include Java, ActiveX, JavaScript, and VBScript.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Blended Attacks              | A blended attack uses multiple infection or transmission methods. For example, a blended attack could combine the propagation methods of viruses and worms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Backdoors                    | A backdoor is a malicious program that listens for commands on a  certain TCP or UDP port. Most backdoors allow an attacker to perform a certain set of actions on a host, such as acquiring passwords or executing arbitrary commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Keystroke Loggers            | A keystroke logger monitors and records keyboard use. Some require the attacker to retrieve the data from the host, whereas other loggers actively transfer the data to another host through email, file transfer, or other means.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rootkit                      | A rootkit is a collection of files that is installed on a host to alter its standard functionality in a malicious and stealthy way. A rootkit typically makes many changes to a host to hide the  rootkit’s existence, making it very difficult to determine that the rootkit is present and to identify what the rootkit has changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Malware analysis

Malware analysis is a process that uses various tools and techniques to determine
how malicious code is working. Unfortunately, there is no single algorithm to
indicate how to analyse such code. Various approaches are usually needed including
static analysis, behavioural analysis, executable debugging or analysis of
disassembled code. Moreover, each analyst usually tends to have his or her own
favourite techniques and preferred tools.

## Types of malware analysis

There are various approaches to malware analysis each having a different purpose and
application. Usually more than one approach is used to gather necessary information
about the sample in question.

### Basic static analysis

In this analysis, the file structure of a malware sample is analysed without executing
malicious code. The goal of this analysis is to gather information about potential
malware functionality and any characteristic file features that could later be used
to create malware signature. During the analysis various elements are checked such as:

- Strings list
- Import/Export tables
- List of file sections
- File resources
- PE headers
- Signatures of well-known packers.
- Embedded objects (images, executables, etc.)

### Basic dynamic analysis

In this analysis, malicious code is intentionally executed in a controlled environment
to observe what changes it makes to the operating system. We monitor elements like file:

- System changes
- Changes in the Windows registry
- Changes on the process list
- System resources usage
- Other visible anomalies (e.g. disappearing files)
- Signs of rootkit activity

Based on observed system changes the analyst tries to deduce some of the malware’s
functionality. Behavioural analysis also allows us to determine the malware’s persistence
mechanism and indicators of infection. Knowledge about the persistence mechanism and
infection indicators might be used to identify other infected workstations and to
disinfect them.

### Advanced static analysis

In advanced static analysis, malicious code is disassembled and then analysed for malware
functionality and the algorithms used. This type of analysis is usually time consuming and
requires good reverse engineering (RE) skills and a deep knowledge of system internals.
One advantage with static analysis is that malicious code is never executed. It is also
possible to analyse parts of the code that are never executed during dynamic analysis. The
disadvantage of this analysis in that it is usually hard to predict the execution path and
follow registry and stack changes.

During advanced dynamic analysis, malicious code is executed in a debugger – letting the
analyst precisely follow the malware execution path. Debugger analysis reveals the various
execution paths and algorithms used by malware (e.g. the encryption algorithm used for
network communication). Advanced dynamic analysis is usually more time consuming than
other types of analyses and requires good reverse engineering (RE) skills as well as a
deep knowledge of system internals.

### Network analysis

Network analysis is usually performed alongside behavioural analysis. During network
analysis, the malware sample is executed in a controlled environment while all network
traffic is captured. Then the analyst checks what hosts the malware was communicating
with and searches for any well-known network traffic patterns (e.g. spam sending).
Network analysis is usually a great source of information about malware functionality
and often helps to identify the particular malware family. Thanks to network analysis
it is often possible to identify addresses of (command and control) (C&C) servers and
specific botnet to which a malware belongs.

### Automatic analysis

In automatic analysis, malware is uploaded to a dedicated system which will perform
automatic preliminary analysis. Automatic analysis usually produces similar results
to the basic static analysis, behavioural analysis and network analysis. It also usually
takes least time of all other analyses and is often used to quickly check a malware
sample.

## Goals of malware analysis

Because malware analysis is usually a complex task, it is always important to have
a clear goal in mind. Some common analysis goals are: determining infection
indicators in order to detect other infected computers, determining malware 
propagation mechanism to more effectively prevent future infections or getting to
know malicious code functionality to assess the risk associated with potential
infection.

Malware samples are usually quite complex. Some samples are fairly easy
to analyse while others require a deep knowledge of system internals and advanced 
reverse engineering skills to analyse. In general, to perform basic malware analysis 
some basic system administration knowledge and programming background is needed.
And on the network level it is good to know the network stack and have some knowledge
about popular network protocols (ICMP,TCP, UDP, HTTP, FTP, SMTP, IRC, etc.).
