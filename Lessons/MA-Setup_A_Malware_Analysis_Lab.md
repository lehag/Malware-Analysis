# Setup a malware analysis lab

## The analysis environment

The analysis environment is a system consisting of virtual machines and an
isolated virtual network. Its role is to allow users to perform artifacts
analysis and then to examine collected results. 

## Flare VM

1\. In a Virtual Machine, search for the following website:
[https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm](https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm).

2\. Download the project.

3\. Decompress the previous file.

4\. Start a new session of PowerShell with escalated privileges.
FLARE VM attempts to install additional software and modify
system settings; therefore, escalated privileges are required
for installation.

5\. Within PowerShell, change directory to the location where
you have decompressed the FLARE VM repository.

6\. Enable unrestricted execution policy for PowerShell by
executing the following command and answering “Y” when
prompted by PowerShell:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted
```

7\. Execute the install.ps1 installation script. You will be
prompted to enter the current user’s password. FLARE VM needs
the current user’s password to automatically login after a
reboot when installing.

```bash
./install.ps1
```

8\. Wait until the installation has finished.

9\. Once the installation completes, the PowerShell prompt
remains open waiting for you to hit any key before exiting.
Type **ENTER.**

10\. Turn off the VM.

11\. Take a new snapshot of the new Flare VM installation.

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use a 64-bits VM, otherwise,
some tools won’t be installed such as Volatility, Metasploit,
etc.
